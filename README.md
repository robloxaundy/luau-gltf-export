# luau-gltf-export
This is a plugin/library originally created for Roblox hackweek.

The easiest way to run it is to load ExportGltf.rbxmx, save it as a plugin, and then run serve.luau with lune (lune run serve.luau)

Feel free to cannibalize the the plugin and included library how ever you like! There's some cool stuff in there.
That said it's far from bug free, so you might have to tweak it to work with your exact needs
